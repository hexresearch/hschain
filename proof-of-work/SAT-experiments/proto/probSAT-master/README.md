The probSAT SAT Solver

An efficient implementation of a variant of the probSAT solver presented in:

"Choosing Probability Distributions for Stochastic Local Search and the Role of Make versus Break" by
Adrian Balint, Uwe Sch√∂ning

published in Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2012, Volume 7317, Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing - SAT 2012, pages 16-29

This version does not track the make values of variables and is thus also not able to use them. 

=======
To build the solver run:

make

=======
To run the solver:

./probSAT instance.cnf <seed>

=======
The solver accepts a series of parameters which can be displayed by typing:

./probSAT -h
