-- Abstract API for storing of blockchain. Storage works as follows:
--
--  * Blockchain is stored in some databases (on in memory for testing
--    purposes)
--
--  * Rounds' state is kept in memory so it will be lost in case of
--    crash but incoming messages are stored in write ahead log so
--    they could be replayed.
